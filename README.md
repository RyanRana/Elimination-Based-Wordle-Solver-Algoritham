# Elimination-Based-Wordle-Solver-Algoritham

code coming soon!
<br><br>
A python application that solves actual wordles. Firstly uses words with maximum amount of common letters and then uses response on the guessed word to eliminate specific words that don't satisfy existing conditions and then using the new list to find which words have the most common letters, this process is repeated over and over again. 
<br><br>
Common letters are ranked by lexico. English 5 letter word list by Donald Knuth. List published by charlesreid1 on github.
